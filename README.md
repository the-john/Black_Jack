# Black Jack using Monte Carlo Methods

My first delve into using Monte Carlo Methods.

The [Monte_Carlo_Solutions.ipynb](https://github.com/the-john/Black_Jack/blob/master/Monte_Carlo_Solution.ipynb) Jupyter Notebook is where the implementation resides.
The [plot_utils.py]() file contains a plotting function for visualizing State-Value Functions and Policies.

This Jupyter Notebook provides sample code to play Blackjack with a random policy.  

There is also some good sample code for plotting an Action-Value Function Estimate as well as a State-Value Function.
